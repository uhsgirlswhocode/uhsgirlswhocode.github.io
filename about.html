          <p>
            UHS Girls Who Code hosts weekly lessons on Tuesdays in room 509B (Mr. Kinney's room). In a society where the gender disparity still remains prominent, particularly in STEM fields, we seek to bridge this gap by improving girls' confidence and enhancing their computer science skills in everything from HTML to Java to Python to React. We strive to educate, equip, and inspire girls with the computing skills they'll need to pursue 21st century opportunities. Members of all levels are welcome - no experience necessary!

          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <p>Our weekly lessons consist of lectures from members of our club board. We will be guiding girls through the process of creating their own mobile applications with MIT App Inventor, building their own website from HTML and JS, leading girls in crafting their own games and animations through Java and Python, and inspiring the next generation of women engineers with guest speakers from local tech companies. </p>
