        <h1>UHS Girls Who Code</h1>
        <p>UHS Girls Who Code Club is a student-run club that aims to empower girls in STEM fields, particularly in computer science. We teach a variety of topics, such as mobile app development, Java, Python, and website development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

          <h3>HTML/CSS/JS</h3>
          <p>We'll be tackling HTML/CSS/JS concepts with our first major unit of the year - website design! Later on, we'll be introducing a website design competition, where the winner will be able to win a gift card as a reward for their creativity and effective use of the components learned from the lecture.</p>

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>Python will constitute our second major unit of the year, as we'll be diving into some more advanced concepts of Python while creating our own Python games, such as Hangman and Ghost, as well as experimenting with various aesthetic designs with Turtle graphics! </p>

          <img src="./img/MIT App Inventor.jpg">
          <h3>App Development/Java</h3>
          <p>These are our two smaller units - App Development will take place at the beginning of the year with MIT App Inventor, an introductory unit meant to stimulate the interest in computer science among our new students. Java will be our closing unit at the end of the year, serving as an introduction to the AP Computer Science course that many of our members will take as they become upperclassmen.</p>
